Based on your InvisInk project requirements, here's a comprehensive prompt you can use:
InvisInk Project Prompt
"Create a complete computer vision project called 'InvisInk' - an air-drawing math problem solver that recognizes hand-drawn mathematical equations in real-time and provides solutions."
Project Requirements:
Core Functionality:

Use OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time fingertip tracking
Implement gesture-based control system (no voice commands or LLMs)
Train custom CNN on personal handwritten dataset
Solve mathematical expressions and display results

Dataset Specifications:

Custom handwritten symbols: digits (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /, (, ))
30-50 samples per class minimum
28x28 pixel images, grayscale format
Data collected using fingertip drawing interface

Gesture Control System:

Fingertip extended: Drawing mode (start/continue drawing symbol)
Closed fist: Stop drawing current symbol (trigger recognition)
Thumbs up: Submit complete equation for solving
Open hand: Clear canvas and reset

Technical Implementation:

CNN architecture for symbol classification (16 classes)
Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
Drawing canvas system for air-drawing capture
Mathematical expression parser and solver
Professional UI with visual feedback

Workflow Example:
User draws "2" (fingertip) → Fist (recognize "2") → 
Draw "+" (fingertip) → Fist (recognize "+") → 
Draw "3" (fingertip) → Fist (recognize "3") → 
Thumbs up → Display "5"
Platform: Google Colab compatible with organized cell structure
Expected Deliverables:

Complete working application
Data collection tools
Training pipeline
Model evaluation metrics
Professional code documentation
Ready-to-demonstrate system

Key Constraints:

No pre-trained models or LLMs
Only personal handwritten dataset
Real-time performance (30 FPS)
Intuitive gesture-based interface
Suitable for college major project submission
